        Who Am I?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Iâ€™m a full-stack developer from Mexico who is mainly interested in web technologies.
        Developing my skills as a self-taught person with books and online platforms (like 
        Platzi, Udemy, and Pluralsight).
        My curiosity makes me able to quickly learn new tools and technologies when needed.
        Last but not least, I like simplicity.
